# Notebooks

The project is accompanied by some notebooks in which we perform data analysis
and analysis of results.

1. Data exploration: patient statistics, analysis of CFD data
2. Data augmentation: prototyping and visualization of the different data augmentation methods
3. Artery perimeters:
   1. Perimeter computation: set up algorithms before scripting + visualization
   2. Perimeter analysis: find and visualize regions of fastest narrowing, find lengthscale for matrix exponential of 
   the Laplacian
4. Baseline models: train baseline models and visualize results
5. Sweep analysis: model selection by analyzing wandb results of hyperparameter tuning
6. Results table: compare model results
